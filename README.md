This is a simple MATLAB code for solving one dimension transient heat transfer problems.

There are some parameters its better to introduce it to you:

lambda => Heat Conductivity
rho => Density
c => Heat Capacity
A => Area
noe => Number of Elements
not => Number of time steps
T => Initial Temperature
L => Length of bar

You can change these parameters based on your needs.

I put this code in a loop for defferent boundry conditions because i wanted to create a data base for my projects.

You can find the original code in "Finite Element Method for 1D Transient Convective Heat Transfer Problems" Thesis for Mr. Whokko SchirÂ´en.
